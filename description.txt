Originally a continuation of my first mod, "Epikmod", this mod basically adds whatever ideas I have that don't fit in one of my more "themed" mods (which has upgraded from glitchy chainsaw bullets to an arsenal of unique, sometimes esoteric weapons, potions, accessories, pylons, and more since I started Epikmod)
Icon coming as soon as I figure out a design, have a potato for now

Tyfyter2002 (you know, the dev of the mod)
The helpful folks in the tModLoader discord, without whom I'd never have fixed many of the bugs.

The Thorium devs, without whom the Thorium crossover content (i.e. bard & healer items) obviously wouldn't be possible.

Special Thanks to the 7387 people who've downloaded the original mod.
Wait, why is it 7395 now...
7477? Are people still using tML v0.8.2.1?
7574. How is it still available?
Gott sei Dank it's finally gone.

Once I find an excuse to put shaders on the minimap credit for the idea goes to Chee
