A continuation of my first mod, "Epikmod", this mod basically adds whatever I think of that doesn't fit in another mod (which has since upgraded from glitchy chainsaw bullets to an arsenal of unique, sometimes esoteric weapons, potions, accessories, and more)

Special Thanks to the 7387 people who've downloaded the original mod.
Wait, why is it 7395 now...
